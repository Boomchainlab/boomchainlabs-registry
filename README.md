> A decentralized, modular, and upgradeable smart contract registry maintained by [Boomchainlab](https://github.com/Boomchainlab).

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Boomchainlabs Registry** provides an on-chain mapping for smart contract discoverability across modules, systems, and deployments. It supports plug-and-play registry patterns for multi-chain apps, proxies, governance modules, and DAO architectures.

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔐 Secure registration of contract addresses
- 📡 On-chain discovery by contract name (hash-based)
- 🔄 Upgrade-friendly and DAO-integrable
- ⚙️ Built with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) and CI-ready
- ✅ Verified with Etherscan (if secrets are provided)

    function register(bytes32 name, address addr) external {
        require(addr != address(0), "Invalid address");
        _registry[name] = addr;
    }

    function get(bytes32 name) external view returns (address) {
        return _registry[name];
    }

🛠 Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure the following are installed:
	•	Foundry
	•	GitHub CLI or GitHub PAT with repo permissions
	•	An RPC endpoint (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode)
	•	Optional: Etherscan API key for contract verification

⸻

🧪 Run Tests Locally

Clone and test locally:
git clone https://github.com/Boomchainlab/boomchainlabs-registry.git
cd boomchainlabs-registry
foundryup
forge install
forge build
forge test --gas-report
🚀 Deploy to Blockchain

To deploy on a target network with verification:
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployRegistry \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
🔁 CI/CD Workflow

On every push to main, the GitHub Actions workflow:
	•	✅ Builds with Foundry
	•	✅ Runs full unit tests
	•	✅ Broadcasts and verifies the deployment (when configured)
	•	✅ Generates a gas usage report

📄 See: .github/workflows/ci-deploy.yml

🔍 Core Contract

Registry.sol
contract Registry {
    mapping(bytes32 => address) public registeredContracts;

    function register(bytes32 name, address contractAddress) external {
        registeredContracts[name] = contractAddress;
    }

    function get(bytes32 name) external view returns (address) {
        return registeredContracts[name];
    }
}
📦 Use Cases
	•	🌐 Publicly queryable contract registry
	•	🔐 Modular upgrades with proxy pattern
	•	🪄 Interface registration and discovery
	•	📘 DAO plugin architecture

⸻

🧠 Roadmap
	•	IPFS metadata + SHA validation support
	•	Multichain deployment (Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)
	•	zkSync, Starknet adapters
	•	Role-based access + DAO registry
	•	Real-time GitHub webhook integration
